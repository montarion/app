???: Alpha 0.1 in testing

21-08-18: Alpha 0.2 in testing. updates include better looking code, and always on sockets for the server through a service.
          Aims for the next version include sending my ip to the server if it changes.
28-08-18: Alpha 0.3 working. sends ip to server(not on change, do manual refresh). works outside.
