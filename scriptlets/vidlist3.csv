From November 14 - December 16 I'll be touring all around the U.S. Grab your tickets at www.betterplacestour.com Around 2 years ago I was in Miami for WMC/Ultra week and I was at my hotel getting ready to go play a gig. I had been reading Keith Richards' memoir called ""Life"" and I really loved how much he talked about his musical influences throughout the book. One of those influences was Bo Diddley. After I had listened to a few of Diddley's songs, one song in particular had this moment that kept looping in my mind. I pulled out my laptop right before my show and created the first, really rough version of this remix...I really enjoyed making this and I am so happy to share it with you after so long!
